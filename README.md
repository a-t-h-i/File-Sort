# File-Sort
A CLI based file sorting program that sorts files based on file extension by creating a folder for the files

Usage:

File-Sort allows you to compress files of a certain (specified) extension into an archive and gives you the option to delete them after the files have been compressed successfully.

That can be done using these commands:

Compress files of specified extension
sort -c <extension> 

Compress files of specified extension and then delete them
sort -cd <extension>
